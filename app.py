It helps small businesses organise all of their data and customers in one central place, allowing them to streamline business operations, increase revenue per customer, and build stronger brand connection between them and their customers.

CRM sounds interesting but I'm not sure this is really what we need right now. We already know a lot of our customers by name and, for the price you're charging, it seems a little expensive. 

Maybe I'm not understanding the value of the tool but I don't see a truly compelling reason as to why we need this tool. 

Thanks but I'm not sure this is the right fit.
